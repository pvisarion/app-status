Demo process table

Run the app: yarn start

Test the app: yarn test

The table has been implemented in two ways, one using html table layout, the other using flexbox layout.

For the table layout implementation, there are unit tests for components and also accessibility tags.

The flexbox layout one's purpose is to have an idea about how it would look/behave using this approach.
